# Label the Cow

This is my tech test for the Telesgop Web Developer role. You are instructed to label organs of the cow, and can check your answers once you have a label in each box. If all are correct, a completion message will show. If only some are correct, you will see ticks and crosses near correct / wrong answers.

## To start

Once forked and open in your code editor, please do the following:

### `1) npm i`

To install all needed dependencies!

### `2) npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode on localhost:3000.
 
## If I had more time / future implementations 

If I had more time, I'd add more functionality. For example, labels at the bottom could disappear once dragged to the diagram. As well as this, I think it could be fun to make a mobile-friendly version of this challenge. However, as this was my first attempt at drag and drop code, I am reasonably happy with the result! Adding more styling is definitely something I am going to continue even after submitting the tech test, as well as testing responsiveness. Accessibility should also be added to make this challenge available for even more students.
