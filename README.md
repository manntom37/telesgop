# Label the Cow

This is my tech test for the Telesgop Web Developer role. You are instructed to label organs of the cow, and can check your answers once you have a label in each box. If all are correct, a completion message will show. If only some are correct, you will see ticks and crosses near correct / wrong answers.

## To start

Once forked and open in your code editor, please do the following:

### `1) npm i`

To install all needed dependencies!

### `2) npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode on localhost:3000.
